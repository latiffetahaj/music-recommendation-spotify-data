## Background and Motivation


Music has been an important part of human history since prehistoric times. Its importance
lies in its ability to connect people, communicate ideas and emotions that words cannot transmit.
It has the power to uplift peopleâ€™s moods, inspire new ideas, increase creativity and focus,
promote relaxation and better sleep, boost exercise performance, etc. These wide range of
benefits and the tight relationship between humans and music is what inspired people to create
apps and products that stream music from a wide range of genres. 

From all the apps, Spotify is my favorite. It uses powerful machine learning algorithms to learn about user preferences and
recommend new songs, playlists, artists, etc. Since I am a daily user of Spotify, I was curious to
know how Spotify works in the background and how I can use its API to retrieve and write
information to my account.
